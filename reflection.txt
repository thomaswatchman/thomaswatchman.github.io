This website did not turn out as well as I would have liked. It does not look the way that
I had originally intended when starting assignment 1. I found that I cared more about
simply completing the assignment requirements than making my website look the way that I wanted.
Unfortunately I do not thing that this website will ever achieve what I had hoped for it. It
would have been better if I had clearer intentions at the beginning, but I did not. I would have
liked to have better content to put on the website as well such as coding projects or film
projects. In summary, I feel that I did not put in the extra effort to make this project something
that I am proud of.
